Shausgha in Yazilikaya
Hittite Empire
1300-1200
Hattusa
Shaushga was such an important goddess in the Hittite pantheon in Yazilikaya. Usually the gods in the Pantheon were male but she was female, so she was really important since she was carved.


Hattusa
Hittite Empire
1300-1200
Hattusa
Hattusa was the capital of the Hittite Empire in the late Bronze Age. This is it. There were about 30 temples within the walls


Lion-headed king
Hittite Empire
1300-1200
Hattusa
There was a lion-headed king who was keeping away evil spirits from Chamber B. This was in Yazilikaya.


Yazilikaya
n/a
n/a
Hattusa
Procession. Yazilikaya was a sanctuary in Hattusa, the capital of the Hittite Empire. There are rock-cut reliefs portraying the gods of the Hittite pantheon. The hieroglyphics of the Hittites were different than that of the Egyptians. Gods featured include the sun-god.


Temple of Ishtar-Kititum
n/a
n/a
Ishchali
The temple of lshtar-Kititum at Ishchali, east of modern Baghdad, was built after the fall of Ur and belonged to the independent kingdom of Eshnunna, with its capital at modern Tell Asmar. It was dedicated to a form of the Mother Goddess, Ishtar-Kititum. Architectural arrangements are complex. Instead of a single-chambered shrine there is a court and the deity is approached through an antecella. This is the largest and most important of the three temples which make up the ingeniously planned assembly of religious buildings at Ishchali. It was built in 1800 BC.

Note that his image is slightly different and looks like that on pg 108 of the book


Nintu, the Lady of Births
Isin-Larsa
2025-1763 
Mesopotamia
Shows the Mother Goddess as 'Lady of Births'. At each of Nintu's shoulder is a child's head, while two naked embryonic figures appear on either side, with the symbol of the goddess above them. They liked to portray the Mother Goddess Nintu (and perhaps other deities?) in different forms.


Relief of the demon Humbaba
Isin-Larsa
2025-1763 
Mesopotamia
Relief of the demon Humbaba, which was occasionally seen in the entrails of a sacrificial animal which were inspected to obtain omens. ON the plaque the face is rendered by a single continuous band, to suggest the entrails, in which the face appeared. 


Puzur-Ishtar of Mari
Isin-Larsa
2025-1763 
Mari
Broad but sensitive treatment of the bare parts of the body with an extraordinary elaboration of all of the details of drress and hair


Ishtup-ilum of Mari
Isin-Larsa
2025-1763
Mari
The statue of Ishtup-ilum of Mari shows a simplification of forms. This is a provicincial trait.


Statuette of Hammurabi kneeling in adoration
n/a
n/a

Shows Hammurabi kneeling before the god in whose temple it was placed. In a relief on the side of the base the king is shown once again in this attitude before a goddess on a throne, but the accompanying inscription states the object was dedicated to the god Amurru for the life of Hammurabi. On the other side is a ram. In front there is a small basin, either a bowl for water or intended to hold grains of incense. Most striking feature is the intense animation of the work.


Figure of a four-faced god
Old Babylonian(?)

Lamassu
Neo-Assyrian
883-859
Nimrud (Kalakh)
Under Assurnasirpal II. Winged, with 5 legs. The lamassu was under control by the gods or Assurnasipal himself. This is the king's personal, protective demon. The idea is to instill fear and awe into the common people, who were supertstitious.


Assurnasirpal with Griffin Men
Neo-Assyrian
883-859
Nimrud (Kalakh)
Elaborate trees and life. Very elaborate, symmetrical. Running across the face of every sculpture is a cuneiform inscription. Inscription:
"The palace of Assurnasirpal, chief priest of Assur...the divine weapon of the Great Gods, the potent king, the king of the world, the king of Assyria.."

This is known as the standard inscription because every slab has the exact same inscription.


Griffin Men

Assurnasirpal killing lions from a chariot
Neo-Assyrian
883-859
Northwest Palace at Nimrud (Kalakh)
Assurnasirpal killing lions. Showing his strength. There's also a ritual element, as if it's something a king has to do to show his greatness. We know Mesopotamian rulers have been fighting lions since Jemdet Nasr. Hunting was one aspect with which rulers presented themselves.


Assurnasirpal hunting bulls
Neo-Assyrian
883-859
Northwest Palace at Nimrud (Kalakh)
Similar to lion hunting, here Assurnasirpal is hunting bulls.

Isosceles triangles is a symbol for a king (?). An attendant has brought a bull for sacrifice. PUGNUS-Mili is like his predecessor in Yazilakaya IV, with the long robe trailing behind and the curved staff, which was an imperial indication of kingship. Main difference is that Yazilakaya IV was wearing a skullcap while PUGNUS-Mili is wearing a cartoonish hat.

So here he's calling himself a king. However, there's no isosceles triangle so he wasn't a "Great King" (title). He was subservient to others

Goddess Ningal from Ur

2025-1763 
Mesopotamia
The goddess Ningal, spouse of the moon-god Nannar, who was the tutelary (protector/guardian) deity of Ur, and it was dedicated by the high priestess of the goddess who was a daughter of king Ishme-Dagan of Isin. This is an excellently carved statue.

This is continuity: both of them are the same guy, and this is a cool concept of continuity. Tikulti-Ninurta is being very pious and kneeling before the god. Surely he wouldn't have knelt before any mortal


Assurnasirpal on Stool
Neo-Assyrian
883-859
Northwest Palace at Nimrud (Kalakh)
We often see Assurnasirpal in these suites being attended by his servants with very elaborate furniture, living the high life.

Shows military prowess and him being pampered by the divines. Used to overwhelm the people that came to visit him.


Assurnasirpal being blessed by genii
Neo-Assyrian
883-859
Northwest Palace at Nimrud (Kalakh)
Assurnasirpal on each side and a tree in the middle and genii (plural of genius) on the outside with ever-present buckets and pine cones, protecting Asurnassirpal. It’s very symmetrical, but not a mirror image. Assurnasirpal himself is connected with that cosmic balance. This is meant to overhwelm, intimidate, and put you in your place. Assur is hovering directly overhead in his sun-disk.

Symbolizes cosmic order b/c it's symmetrical, and also shows balance between the divine and everything else.


Wall-relief of river-side Ambush
Neo-Assyrian
883-859

This is a popular Assyrian activity. People are swimming and trying to make it to the walled city, though archers are shooting at them. The swimmers are blowing into pigskins, which they used as flotation devices. The people at the destination are waiting for the swimmers.

Shows non-specific military activity.

Katuwas doesn't look anything like a Hittite king or like PUTNUS-mili. He's dressed like most regular males in these sculptures, with that long garment with fringes and a wide belt. There's a sword through the belt to reflect his military prowess. Long beard, and typical of men of Carchemish is a bun. Behind him we have hieroglyphic inscriptions. 

Most of the hieroglyphic inscriptions we have belong to the Neo-Hittite period.

Very well fortified, very cleverly designed for maximum protection because invaders would be surrounded by walls on 3 sides.


Tower
Hittite Empire
1300-1200
Hattusa
Depicts the cyclopean walls and defensive towers that surrounded the acropolis. These are dipylon-type gates. Lots of advantages to this because if you invaded you would quickly be surrounded and people could throw things at you from above. This is the preferred gate plane in Anatolia and Syria down to the first millenium BC.

Plan that was used when building the castle.

Relief of Lilith
Isin-Larsa (Old Babylonian)
2025-1763 
Mesopotamia
Reliefs such as this that show the gods in full front view establish a relation with all who approach. It is somber and sinister. The goddess is winged, and the legs, between knee and talon, are feathered. She is the bringer of death. Moving soundlessly and at night, men sometimes catch sight of her in the guise of an owl, but her irresistible power, her truly terrifying nature, is leonine rather than bird-like. She is holding measuring ropes, which may indicate the limited span of man's life or his judgement at death. The relif was coloured, and traces of paint still adhere to it; the body was red, the feathers of her wings and those of the owls are black and red alternately, and the manes of the lions black. (pg 110)

Aka Ereshkigal


Head of Hammurabi
Old Babylonian
1894-1595
Susa
The greatest surviving work of the period. Usually regarded as a portrait of the greatest figure of the age, Hammurabi of Babylon (1792-1750 BC). The figure is very rugged but detailed.


Stele with the law code of Hammurabi
Old Babylonian
1894-1595
Made in Babylon, moved to Susa
The king stands before the throne of the sun-gode, the supreme judge; the conjunction of the two figures has been rendered with a fresh awareness of its extraordinary nature. It conveys confrontation and communication between the lord of justice and the law-giver. The scene (excluding code) is two-feet high. Below it appears the law code, which is 7+ feet tall


Lion gate
Hittite Empire
1400-1200
Hattusa
Concept of the portal guardian persists. Hittite megalithic construction with large boulders set in place. If you take a close look, you can see that all the stones of the wall are very carefully fitted to their neighbors. Lions are very detailed, you can even see the fine hairs of their manes. 

Note that the full lions aren't portrayed, but they are shown emerging out of the rock. This gives a magical quality and seems as if 'lions are the gate, and the gate is the lions.' This is a contrast with the sphinx portal guardian.

Lions were very popular and powerful figures.


Hittite god
Hittite Empire
1300-1200
Hattusa (Yazılıkaya in particular)
He has a long robe that trails off behind and a skullcap. As if a symbol of authority, there is a curved staff. These are the marks of the great king. As with the Mesopotamian rulers, there is a discrete way to distinguish the rulers from everybody else. He's standing on mountains, giving him a sense of divinity. We know from Hittite texts that Hittite kings, during their lifetimes, were mortal. But when they died, they became gods. So the king is probably having himself shown as he would when he dies and joins the Hittite Pantheon.

The dude in the picture is the wrong god, but looks similar. Find the right one in the book

Hattusa
Hittite Empire
1300-1200
Hattusa
Hattusa was the capital of the Hittite Empire in the late Bronze Age. This is it. There were about 30 temples within the walls


Yazilikaya
n/a
n/a
Hattusa
Procession. Yazilikaya was a sanctuary in Hattusa, the capital of the Hittite Empire. There are rock-cut reliefs portraying the gods of the Hittite pantheon. The hieroglyphics of the Hittites were different than that of the Egyptians. Gods featured include the sun-god.


Shausgha in Yazilikaya
Hittite Empire
1300-1200
Hattusa
Shaushga was such an important goddess in the Hittite pantheon in Yazilikaya. Usually the gods in the Pantheon were male but she was female, so she was really important since she was carved.


Lion-headed king
Hittite Empire
1300-1200
Hattusa
There was a lion-headed king who was keeping away evil spirits from Chamber B. This was in Yazilikaya.


Temple of Ishtar-Kititum
n/a
n/a
Ishchali
The temple of lshtar-Kititum at Ishchali, east of modern Baghdad, was built after the fall of Ur and belonged to the independent kingdom of Eshnunna, with its capital at modern Tell Asmar. It was dedicated to a form of the Mother Goddess, Ishtar-Kititum. Architectural arrangements are complex. Instead of a single-chambered shrine there is a court and the deity is approached through an antecella. This is the largest and most important of the three temples which make up the ingeniously planned assembly of religious buildings at Ishchali. It was built in 1800 BC.

Note that his image is slightly different and looks like that on pg 108 of the book


Nintu, the Lady of Births
Isin-Larsa
2025-1763 
Mesopotamia
Shows the Mother Goddess as 'Lady of Births'. At each of Nintu's shoulder is a child's head, while two naked embryonic figures appear on either side, with the symbol of the goddess above them. They liked to portray the Mother Goddess Nintu (and perhaps other deities?) in different forms.


Relief of the demon Humbaba
Isin-Larsa
2025-1763 
Mesopotamia
Relief of the demon Humbaba, which was occasionally seen in the entrails of a sacrificial animal which were inspected to obtain omens. ON the plaque the face is rendered by a single continuous band, to suggest the entrails, in which the face appeared. 


Puzur-Ishtar of Mari
Isin-Larsa
2025-1763 
Mari
Broad but sensitive treatment of the bare parts of the body with an extraordinary elaboration of all of the details of drress and hair


Ishtup-ilum of Mari
Isin-Larsa
2025-1763
Mari
The statue of Ishtup-ilum of Mari shows a simplification of forms. This is a provicincial trait.


Statuette of Hammurabi kneeling in adoration
n/a
n/a

Shows Hammurabi kneeling before the god in whose temple it was placed. In a relief on the side of the base the king is shown once again in this attitude before a goddess on a throne, but the accompanying inscription states the object was dedicated to the god Amurru for the life of Hammurabi. On the other side is a ram. In front there is a small basin, either a bowl for water or intended to hold grains of incense. Most striking feature is the intense animation of the work.

Old Babylonian(?)

Lamassu
Neo-Assyrian
883-859
Nimrud (Kalakh)
Under Assurnasirpal II. Winged, with 5 legs. The lamassu was under control by the gods or Assurnasipal himself. This is the king's personal, protective demon. The idea is to instill fear and awe into the common people, who were supertstitious.


Assurnasirpal with Griffin Men
Neo-Assyrian
883-859
Nimrud (Kalakh)
Elaborate trees and life. Very elaborate, symmetrical. Running across the face of every sculpture is a cuneiform inscription. Inscription:
"The palace of Assurnasirpal, chief priest of Assur...the divine weapon of the Great Gods, the potent king, the king of the world, the king of Assyria.."

This is known as the standard inscription because every slab has the exact same inscription.


Griffin Men

Assurnasirpal killing lions from a chariot
Neo-Assyrian
883-859
Northwest Palace at Nimrud (Kalakh)
Assurnasirpal killing lions. Showing his strength. There's also a ritual element, as if it's something a king has to do to show his greatness. We know Mesopotamian rulers have been fighting lions since Jemdet Nasr. Hunting was one aspect with which rulers presented themselves.


Assurnasirpal hunting bulls
Neo-Assyrian
883-859

Similar to lion hunting, here Assurnasirpal is hunting bulls.

PUGNUS-Mili is wearing a conical headdress, pouring libation to god (not shown).  There's a female goddess of war, Shaushka


Frieze block with PUGNUS-Mili and storm god
Neo-Hittite
n/a
Malatya
Isosceles triangles is a symbol for a king (?). An attendant has brought a bull for sacrifice. PUGNUS-Mili is like his predecessor in Yazilakaya IV, with the long robe trailing behind and the curved staff, which was an imperial indication of kingship. Main difference is that Yazilakaya IV was wearing a skullcap while PUGNUS-Mili is wearing a cartoonish hat.

So here he's calling himself a king. However, there's no isosceles triangle so he wasn't a "Great King" (title). He was subservient to others

Goddess Ningal from Ur
Isin-Larsa
2025-1763 
Mesopotamia
The goddess Ningal, spouse of the moon-god Nannar, who was the tutelary (protector/guardian) deity of Ur, and it was dedicated by the high priestess of the goddess who was a daughter of king Ishme-Dagan of Isin. This is an excellently carved statue.

This is continuity: both of them are the same guy, and this is a cool concept of continuity. Tikulti-Ninurta is being very pious and kneeling before the god. Surely he wouldn't have knelt before any mortal


Assurnasirpal on Stool
Neo-Assyrian
883-859
Northwest Palace at Nimrud (Kalakh)
We often see Assurnasirpal in these suites being attended by his servants with very elaborate furniture, living the high life.

Shows military prowess and him being pampered by the divines. Used to overwhelm the people that came to visit him.


Assurnasirpal being blessed by genii
Neo-Assyrian
883-859
Northwest Palace at Nimrud (Kalakh)
Assurnasirpal on each side and a tree in the middle and genii (plural of genius) on the outside with ever-present buckets and pine cones, protecting Asurnassirpal. It’s very symmetrical, but not a mirror image. Assurnasirpal himself is connected with that cosmic balance. This is meant to overhwelm, intimidate, and put you in your place. Assur is hovering directly overhead in his sun-disk.

Symbolizes cosmic order b/c it's symmetrical, and also shows balance between the divine and everything else.


Wall-relief of river-side Ambush
Neo-Assyrian
883-859
Northwest Palace at Nimrud (Kalakh)
This is a popular Assyrian activity. People are swimming and trying to make it to the walled city, though archers are shooting at them. The swimmers are blowing into pigskins, which they used as flotation devices. The people at the destination are waiting for the swimmers.

Shows non-specific military activity.

n/a
Carchemish (Jerablus)
Katuwas doesn't look anything like a Hittite king or like PUTNUS-mili. He's dressed like most regular males in these sculptures, with that long garment with fringes and a wide belt. There's a sword through the belt to reflect his military prowess. Long beard, and typical of men of Carchemish is a bun. Behind him we have hieroglyphic inscriptions. 

Most of the hieroglyphic inscriptions we have belong to the Neo-Hittite period.

Very well fortified, very cleverly designed for maximum protection because invaders would be surrounded by walls on 3 sides.


Tower
Hittite Empire
1300-1200
Hattusa
Depicts the cyclopean walls and defensive towers that surrounded the acropolis. These are dipylon-type gates. Lots of advantages to this because if you invaded you would quickly be surrounded and people could throw things at you from above. This is the preferred gate plane in Anatolia and Syria down to the first millenium BC.

Plan that was used when building the castle.

Relief of Lilith
Isin-Larsa (Old Babylonian)
2025-1763 
Mesopotamia
Reliefs such as this that show the gods in full front view establish a relation with all who approach. It is somber and sinister. The goddess is winged, and the legs, between knee and talon, are feathered. She is the bringer of death. Moving soundlessly and at night, men sometimes catch sight of her in the guise of an owl, but her irresistible power, her truly terrifying nature, is leonine rather than bird-like. She is holding measuring ropes, which may indicate the limited span of man's life or his judgement at death. The relif was coloured, and traces of paint still adhere to it; the body was red, the feathers of her wings and those of the owls are black and red alternately, and the manes of the lions black. (pg 110)

Head of Hammurabi
Old Babylonian
1894-1595

The greatest surviving work of the period. Usually regarded as a portrait of the greatest figure of the age, Hammurabi of Babylon (1792-1750 BC). The figure is very rugged but detailed.


Stele with the law code of Hammurabi
Old Babylonian
1894-1595
Made in Babylon, moved to Susa
The king stands before the throne of the sun-gode, the supreme judge; the conjunction of the two figures has been rendered with a fresh awareness of its extraordinary nature. It conveys confrontation and communication between the lord of justice and the law-giver. The scene (excluding code) is two-feet high. Below it appears the law code, which is 7+ feet tall


Lion gate
Hittite Empire
1400-1200
Hattusa
Concept of the portal guardian persists. Hittite megalithic construction with large boulders set in place. If you take a close look, you can see that all the stones of the wall are very carefully fitted to their neighbors. Lions are very detailed, you can even see the fine hairs of their manes. 

Note that the full lions aren't portrayed, but they are shown emerging out of the rock. This gives a magical quality and seems as if 'lions are the gate, and the gate is the lions.' This is a contrast with the sphinx portal guardian.

Lions were very popular and powerful figures.


Hittite god
Hittite Empire
1300-1200
Hattusa (Yazılıkaya in particular)
He has a long robe that trails off behind and a skullcap. As if a symbol of authority, there is a curved staff. These are the marks of the great king. As with the Mesopotamian rulers, there is a discrete way to distinguish the rulers from everybody else. He's standing on mountains, giving him a sense of divinity. We know from Hittite texts that Hittite kings, during their lifetimes, were mortal. But when they died, they became gods. So the king is probably having himself shown as he would when he dies and joins the Hittite Pantheon.

The dude in the picture is the wrong god, but looks similar. Find the right one in the book
