It was dedicated to a form of the Mother Goddess, Ishtar-Kititum. Architectural arrangements are complex. Instead of a single-chambered shrine there is a court and the deity is approached through an antecella. This is the largest and most important of the three temples which make up the ingeniously planned assembly of religious buildings at Ishchali. It was built in 1800 BC.\n\nNote that his image is slightly different and looks like that on pg 108 of the book',

The goddess is winged, and the legs, between knee and talon, are feathered. She is the bringer of death. Moving soundlessly and at night, men sometimes catch sight of her in the guise of an owl, but her irresistible power, her truly terrifying nature, is leonine rather than bird-like. She is holding measuring ropes, which may indicate the limited span of man\'s life or his judgement at death. The relif was coloured, and traces of paint still adhere to it; the body was red, the feathers of her wings and those of the owls are black and red alternately, and the manes of the lions black.

There were about 30 temples within the wallsYazilikayaHattusan/an/aProcession. Yazilikaya was a sanctuary in Hattusa, the capital of the Hittite Empire. There are rock-cut reliefs portraying the gods of the Hittite pantheon. The hieroglyphics of the Hittites were different than that of the Egyptians. Gods featured include the sun-god.Shausgha in YazilikayaHattusaHittite Empire1300-1200Shaushga was such an important goddess in the Hittite pantheon in Yazilikaya. Usually the gods in the Pantheon were male but she was female, so she was really important since she was carved.Lion-headed kingHattusaHittite Empire1300-1200There was a lion-headed king who was keeping away evil spirits from Chamber B. This was in Yazilikaya.Temple of Ishtar-KititumIshchalin/an/aThe temple of lshtar-Kititum at Ishchali, east of modern Baghdad, was built after the fall of Ur and belonged to the independent kingdom of Eshnunna, with its capital at modern Tell Asmar. It was dedicated to a form of the Mother Goddess, Ishtar-Kititum. Architectural arrangements are complex. Instead of a single-chambered shrine there is a court and the deity is approached through an antecella. This is the largest and most important of the three temples which make up the ingeniously planned assembly of religious buildings at Ishchali. It was built in 1800 BC.

At each of Nintu's shoulder is a child's head, while two naked embryonic figures appear on either side, with the symbol of the goddess above them. They liked to portray the Mother Goddess Nintu (and perhaps other deities?) in different forms.Relief of the demon HumbabaMesopotamiaIsin-Larsa2025-1763 Relief of the demon Humbaba, which was occasionally seen in the entrails of a sacrificial animal which were inspected to obtain omens.

In a relief on the side of the base the king is shown once again in this attitude before a goddess on a throne, but the accompanying inscription states the object was dedicated to the god Amurru for the life of Hammurabi. On the other side is a ram. In front there is a small basin, either a bowl for water or intended to hold grains of incense.
